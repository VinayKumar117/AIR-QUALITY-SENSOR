# Air-Quality-Sensor using Arduino-
An air quality sensor is a device that measures and detects various pollutants in the air.
The results of an air quality sensor can provide important information about the
levels of various pollutants in the air. Some common pollutants that are measured by air quality sensors include
particulate matter, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and others.
Typically, the results of an air quality sensor are presented as numerical values or readings that indicate the
concentration of each pollutant. These readings can be compared to air quality standards or guidelines set by
regulatory agencies to determine if the air quality is within acceptable limits or if it may be harmful to human
health and sends a notification if the levels are worse.
